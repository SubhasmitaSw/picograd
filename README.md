# PicoGrad: The "Tiny" Autograd Engine

## Because size doesn't always matter in ML

Welcome to PicoGrad, the autograd engine that's like that overachieving friend who claims they "didn't study much" but somehow aces every exam. We called it "pico" for the same reason you might call your gaming PC a "little setup" – pure, delightful understatement.

### Why PicoGrad?

- It's like micrograd hit the gym, got a PhD, and learned to juggle – all while claiming to be "not that special"
- Handles distributed tensors because, let's face it, your laptop fans deserve a workout too
- Optimizes graphs faster than you can say "I'll start my diet tomorrow"
